Test scenarios for QingStor SDKs.

## Introduction

We need to make sure that our QingStor SDKs are working properly, and to ensure their functional consistency. So we use scenario testing. Scenario testing is a software testing activity that uses scenarios: hypothetical stories to help the tester work through a complex problem or test system.

## Cucumber

[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber) is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), and can be used for our test. It executes executable specifications written in [plain language](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/docs/gherkin.md) and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the specification or not.

Test scenarios are described in `.feature` files. Every `.feature` file conventionally consists of a single feature, and every feature may have several scenarios.

___Scenario Example:___

``` feature
# PUT Bucket
Scenario: create the bucket
  When put bucket
  Then put bucket status code is 201
```

Given these test scenarios, each SDK could implement the same test flow. Finally, running the test flow against the given features to check whether the SDK is right.

__Running Test in Ruby SDK:__

``` bash
$ cd test
$ cucumber --backtrace --require="./" ./features
...
38 scenarios (38 passed)
84 steps (84 passed)
